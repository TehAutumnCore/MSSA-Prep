# Array Bounds

```cpp

int numbers[] {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}; //10 numbers

//Read beyond bounds : Will read garbage or crash your program
std::cout << "numbers[12] : " << numbers[12] << std::endl;

//Write beyond bounds. The compiler allows it. But you don't own
//the memory at index 12, so other programs may modify it and your
//program may read bogus data at a later time. Or you can even
//corrupt data used by other parts of your program
numbers[12] = 1000;
std::cout << "numbers[12] :" << numbers[12] << std::endl;
