# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
# Traditional Methods
## Waterfall model: Brief overview
Waterfall model follows a linear and sequential approach, meaning each phase's output becomes the input for the next.
    Requirements: Capture all requirements for the project. Involves gathering and documenting what is needed from the software.
    Analysis and Design: Produce high-level design and test specifications. Focuses on creating the architecture and design of the software, including how it will be tested.
    Development: Building the Software System. Where the actual coding and development of the software take place.
    Test: Matching the output of the system with the expected outputs defined in the test specifications. Involves verifying and validating that the software works as intended and meets requirements.
    Deployment and Maintenance: Deploying the application to production and continuing ongoing maintenance. This phase includes releasing the software to users and performing any necessary maintenance and updates.
Errors propagate to all other phases. For example, incomplete or incorrect requirements will lead to incorrect design, and that design will result in an incorrectly developed and missing software feature.
Fixed Scope - Many traditional waterfall projects have fixed scope because you tend to freeze the scope of one phase before starting the next.
Comprehensive system documentation - Processes and final products are generally very well documented in a waterfall project.

What's wrong with Waterfall?
    1. Late delivery of business value: Customer doesn't get to see the product before the early testing phase, which is usually two-thirds of the way through the product timeline. You could be in the development and maintenance phase before you realize the product you were building was no longer viable due to changes in market conditions, organizational direction, or the computer landscape, or the product had a major architectural flaw that prevented it from being deployed. Meaning the product could completely fail after lots of time and money had been spent.
    2. In software development, everything changes. Requirements, skills, people, environment, business rules, etc., and as time progresses, you learn better techniques for doing things. Your stakeholders may need to change requirements to match changing organizational strategy or changing market conditions. The only thing guaranteed is change and the shown process to refine our work.
    3. Precedence of detailed checklists/control processes over people since it is very heavily dependent on judgment and creativity.
## Impact of Waterfall
Documentation and checklists - When waterfall projects began to fail, many organizations treated it as a failure in a production factory, so they tried to add more comprehensive documentation and checklists. However, they do not add direct value to stakeholders and cannot replace the need for iterative.
Applicability - The waterfall model may be suitable for very simple and small systems, ongoing maintenance phases, and mission-critical systems where gate checks are necessary to avoid catastrophic failures.
    Applicable Scenarios:  
        Simple Systems
        Enhancements in ongoing maintenance
        Mission-critical systems (gated phases required)
Domain Knowledge - The waterfall approach can work if the development team has good domain knowledge and both business and technical stakeholders collaborate effectively.
More time should be spent on maneuvering working software features early and often while enlisting customer feedback. 

## Spiral Model
The Spiral model is an iterative software development approach that combines elements of both the waterfall and iterative development models. It focuses on risk management and iterative refinement of the software. Developed in 1986 by Barry Boehm, one of the earliest models to propose iterative development; includes a mix of waterfall and iterative approaches.
    1. Planning: To identify requirements and stakeholders, and to define lifecycle objectives and win conditions for the project.
    2. Risk Analysis: Risk-Identification, Risk prioritization, and mitigation. You'll build prototypes to address risks and explore alternative solutions. 
    3. Engineering: To perform software implementation activities such as detailed design, coding, unit testing, and deployment. Early iterations may involve simple prototypes, while late iterations may produce complete solutions.
    4. Evaluation: Get stakeholder review and feedback. Plan the next iteration on the evaluation.
Each iteration builds on the output of the previous one, allowing for continuous refinement and risk management throughout the development process.

## Rational Unified Process (RUP) Overview
Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a comprehensive iterative software development process developed by Rational Software. It includes artifacts, processes, templates, phases, and disciplines. It has detailed documentation, guidelines, sample artifacts, and deliverables. RUP is influenced by object-oriented analysis, design, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML). It's tailored to fit small, medium, and large software systems using plugins and consists of four phases, each ending with a milestone. 
The Phases of RUP include:
    1. Inception: To define the project scope and objectives, to achieve the "Lifecycle objectives milestone," where stakeholders agree on what to build.
    2. Elaboration: Baseline the architecture of the software system. Reach the "Lifecycle Architecture Milestone."
    3. Construction: Develop the software product, and achieve the "Initial Operational Capability Milestone," where the product is ready for use by end users.
    4. Transition: Fine-tune the application for production. Reach the "Production Release Milestone," making the software fully usable at production scale.
Each phase includes one or more iterations and activities that are grouped into disciplines such as business modeling, requirements, analysis and design, implementation, testing, deployment, configuration, and change management, project management, and environment.

## Rational Unified Process: Life Cycle
Best practices of RUP Principles include:
    1. Iterative Development
    2. Managing requirements and changes
    3. Continuously verifying quality
    4. Visual modeling
    5. Component-based architecture
Shortcomings
    1. Customizable but heavy - heavy process with a lot of documentation, was disliked because it was thought to be needed to be followed religiously and implement all processes and artifacts.
    2. Prescriptive


# Early Agile Methods
## Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is an agile project delivery framework that was developed in 1994 to provide structure to Rapid Application Development (RAD) while maintaining agility. DSDM emphasizes an iterative and incremental approach to building software. Activities are assigned a maximum time limit, which cannot be extended ensuring focus and avoiding unnecessary refinements (timeboxing). Requirements are categorized into Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have (MoSCoW Prioritization). 
The 8 key principles of Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) are:
    1. Focus on the business need: To ensure the project delivers real business benefits
    2. Deliver on time: Timeboxing ensures timely delivery
    3. Collaborate: Effective collaboration between all stakeholders
    4. Never compromise quality: Maintain high standards of quality throughout
    5. Build incrementally from firm foundations: Develop the system in small, manageable increments
    6. Develop Iteratively: Use iterative development to refine and improve the system
    7. Communicate Continuously and clearly: Ensure clear and continuous communication among all team members
    8. Demonstrate Control: Maintain a highly visible plan and manage diligently to stay on track
The Phases of the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) Life Cycle are:
    1. Pre-Project Phase: Projects are identified and funding commitments are made at the portfolio and executive management level
    2. Project Life Cycle Phase: 
        a. Feasibility: Additional feasibility analysis is conducted
        b. Foundations: Detailed planning analysis to establish a solid foundation
        c. Evolutionary Development: The system is built in an iterative and incremental manner
        d. Deployment: The system is deployed to the users
    3. Post-Project Phase: Evaluate if the expected benefits have been realized and look for ways to improve based on what went well and what did not during the project execution.
These phases ensure a structured yet flexible approach to project delivery.

## Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
A feature is a piece of working functionality that has business value and is typically expressed as action, result, object.
Feature-Driven Development (FDD) is a lightweight and agile process where software is viewed as a collection of working features, each providing business value. Feature-Driven Development (FDD) focuses on delivering working software composed of these features through an iterative process. It's structured, feature-focused, and iterative.
Feature-Centric Approach: Software is seen as a collection of working features, each with business value.
Five Steps of Feature-Driven Development (FDD) include: 
    1. Develop Overall Model: Create a high-level initial domain model.
    2. Build Feature List: Divide the domain into subject areas and identify features.
    3. Plan by feature: Prioritize features and develop an implementation plan
    4. Design by feature: Add details to the domain model and create sequence diagrams.
    5. Build by feature: Implement, test, inspect, and deploy the features
Team Organization: Teams are organized around features, allowing parallel work and efficient integration
Tracking Completion: Feature-Driven Development (FDD) uses milestones with assigned completion percentages to track progress.

## Crystal Methods Overview
Crystal method refers to a family of methodologies developed by Alistair Cockburn in the 1990s. These methodologies are people-centric, lightweight, and highly flexible, and they vary based on team size and the criticality of the product being built.
Family of Methodologies: Crystal methods include various methodologies each represented by a color, chosen based on team size and product criticality.
    Crystal Clear: For small teams with low criticality
    Crystal Orange: For larger teams with higher criticality
Criticality and Team Size: The Y-axis represents criticality (severity of damage caused by system malfunction), and the X-axis represents team size.
People-Centric: Crystal methods prioritize people's interactions, effective communication, and collaboration over formal processes.
Frequent Delivery: Emphasize frequent delivery of working software and reflective improvement
Flexibility: The approach is highly flexible, and adapting to different project needs and risks.


# Modern Approaches
## Scrum Overview
Scrum is the most popular and widely adopted agile framework designed for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It's lightweight and consists of a few roles, events, and artifacts. 
The 3 Scrum Roles are:
    1. Product Owner: Owns the product backlog, individual
    2. Scrum Master: Agile Coach, guide/mentor who teaches the scrum team, scrum rules, and practices, and facilitates scrum events if necessary. Leader who removes barriers, and does not manage the development team
    3. Development Team members: Name given to scrum team members, such as developers, testers, documenters, Database Administrators (DBAs), and so forth. Cross-functional and self-organizing
Events include:
    1. Sprints (short iterations)
    2. Daily scrum meetings
    3. Sprint Reviews
Artifacts include:
    1. Product backlog (list of all to-do items)
    2. Sprint backlog (subset of items for the current sprint)
    3. Product increment (working software produced at the end of each sprint)
Scrum emphasizes a small, cross-functional team working in short iterations to create working software. The scrum guide is a key resource for understanding scrum in detail and is available at scrumguides.org

## Scrum workflow
Sprint Planning is an event where the scrum team comes together to decide which items from the product backlog will be worked on during the incoming sprint. The Team drafts a sprint goal which is a high-level business objective for the sprint. The development team creates an initial plan on how to implement the selected items.

Daily Scrum is a 15-minute timeboxed event for the development team to sync up and measure progress towards the sprint goal. 
Team members typically answer three questions:
    1. What did you do since the last Daily Scrum?
    2. What are you planning to do today?
    3. Are there any impediments to your progress?
This event is not a status meeting, but is a chance for the team to ensure they are on track.

Scrum Teams work incrementally and iteratively, starting with Sprint Planning and ending with a Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective. The Development team meets daily in the daily scrum to ensure alignment and progress. At the end of each sprint, a product increment is produced and reviewed. The sprint Retrospective focuses on improving processes, team communication, tools, and skills, highlighting the importance of collaboration and continuous improvement.

## Lean Overview and key concepts
Lean Software Development is a collection of principles centered on the key tenet to minimize waste; originating from the Toyota Production System (TPS) post-WW2 focusing on reducing waste and manufacturing with optimal efficiency. Lean Software development aims to minimize waste through processes that visualize the production pipeline and identify inefficiencies. 

## Lean Value Stream Mapping
Lead Time: The total time taken from customer request to produce/service delivery. For example, if you order a pizza and it arrives in 45 minutes, that is the lead time.
Cycle Time: A subset of lead time, representing the duration of time when actual work is performed on the product. In the pizza example, this would include the time spent baking and packaging the pizza.
Value Stream Mapping (VSM): A technique used to visualize the workflow and identify areas for improvement. It helps in spotting inefficiencies and reducing lead time to match cycle time.

In summary, VSM is used to improve business processes by identifying and minimizing waste.

## Lean Principles
The principles of Lean include:
    1. Eliminate Waste: Focus on value addition for the customer and remove any process or work that does not add value
    2. Amplify Learning: Use iterative practice and frequent feedback to adapt to changing requirements and priorities
    3. Decide as Late as Possible: Make decisions at the last responsible moment to reduce risks associated with early decisions
    4. Deliver as Fast as Possible: Provide working features quickly and often to bring value to the customer
    5. Empower the team: Foster creativity and motivation by giving the team autonomy and support
    6. Build Integrity In: Ensure the system delivers value and is easy to maintain through thorough testing and continuous communication
    7. See the Whole: Optimize the entire workflow rather than just individual steps to improve the overall process
These principles help maximize efficiency and minimize waste in software.

## Kanban
Kanban is a work process management methodology based on lean principles focusing on visualizing work and limiting work in progress. Its core values are to "visualize your work" and "limit work in progress."
Key Concepts of Kanban are:
    Visualize your work: Use Kanban board to represent the status of work items. Each vertical lane shows different stages such as planning, design, development, and acceptance. 
    Limit Work in Progress (WIP): Set limits on the number of items in each lane to ensure optimal efficiency and prevent overloading the team
    Work Queues: Each lane acts as a queue, and items move from one lane to the next as they progress
    Little's Law: A formula to optimize efficiency by balancing the number of items in a queue with the time spent on each item and the arrival rate of new items.
Kanban helps visualize the workflow and manage work items efficiently. Limited Work in Progress (WIP) ensures that the team works at optimal efficiency. The Kanban board provides a quick, summarized view of the work in progress, helping teams stay organized and focused, showing how Kanban can be applied to software development to improve workflow and efficiency.

## Kanban Board
Kanban board is a visual process management tool that helps teams visualize their workflow and identify bottlenecks. It typically consists of columns representing different stages of the process, such as "Planning/Coordination" and "Design." Each column has a WIP limit to prevent overloading and ensure optimal efficiency. Items are pulled into a queue when there is room, rather than being pushed based on a schedule allowing for continuous delivery. The board also helps identify where items are stuck as seen with the view trainer profiles. Item marked as blocked in the example. Besides the board, daily standups are commonly used to keep the team aligned making it lightweight and flexible, facilitating smoother workflow management.

## Extreme Programming (XP)
Extreme Programming (XP) is a fine-grained, implementation-centric approach to software development. It emphasizes customer-driven iterative development with short weekly iterations and continuous feedback.
Key practices of Extreme Programming (XP) include: 
    1. Pair Programming: Two developers work together at one computer with one writing code and the other reviewing it in real-time. They switch roles periodically
    2. Test-Driven Development (TDD): Write tests before writing the actual code. The process involves writing a test, ensuring it fails, then writing just enough code to pass the test and finally refactoring the code
    3. Continuous Integration: Frequently integrate and test code to detect and fix issues early
    4. Refactoring: Continuously improve the code to enhance quality and reduce technical debt.
    5. Just-In-Time Design: Start with a simple design and evolve it as needed throughout the development process.
Extreme Programming (XP) promotes a collaborative approach where customers provide requirements, and developers break them into tasks. Short iterations and continuous feedback loops help in adapting to changes quickly. Pair Programming and TDD are highlighted as effective practices for improving code quality and reducing defects. XP is known for its simplicity and effectiveness, especially for small to medium-sized projects.

## Spotify Engineering model
The spotify model is an agile approach that emphasizes a culture of principles and values rather than following a specific framework. It combines various frameworks, methodologies, and practices to create a unique approach to agility. 
Major take aways could include:
    1. Autonomous Squads: Teams are organized into small, autonomous units called squads
    2. Frequent Releases: spotify focuses on small, frequent releases with maximum automation, using release trains and feature toggles
    3. Continuous Improvement: The culture promotes continous improvements through techniques like the Kata Board.
    4. Innovation: Hackathons and cross-team learning foster innovation and knowledge sharing
    5. Agility Over Frameworks: Spotify prioritizes agility and flexibility over strict adherence to any single framework.

## Spotify Engineering Culture
Spotify's Agile model emphasizes autonomy and freedom for teams to select what works best for them. Teams often use a combination of scrum and kanban with core values based on lean principles. The model minimizes bureaucracy and encourages a failure-friendly culture to foster creativity and experimentation. The smallesst team unit in the spotify agile model is a squad.
Operations of Squads include:
    1. Squads are autonomous, self-organizing and cross functional typically comprising 1-7 members.
    2. They have the freedom to decide what to build and how to build it
    3. Squads work in a highly collaborative environment and are co-located 
    4. Squads are organized into tribes, which are groups of squads working on related areas
    5. Chapters and guilds provide additional organizational structures for expertise and common interests across squads and tribes.
