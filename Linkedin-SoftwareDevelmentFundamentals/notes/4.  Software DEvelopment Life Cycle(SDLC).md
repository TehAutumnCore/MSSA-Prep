# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
# Traditional Methods
## Waterfall model: Brief overview
Waterfall model follows a linear and sequential approach, meaning each phases output becomes the input for the next.
    Requirements: Capture all requirements for the project. Involves gathering and documenting what is needed from the software
    Analysis and Design: Produce high-level design and test specifications. Focuses on creating the architecture and design of the software including how it will be tested
    Development: Building the Software System. Where the actual coding and development of the software take place.
    Test: Matching the output of the system with the exppecting outputs defined in the test specifications. Involves verifying and validating that the software works as intended and meets     requirements.
    Development and Maintenance: Deploying the application to production and continue ongoing maintenance.This phase includes releasing the software to users and performing any necessary maintenance and updates.
Errors propagate to all other phases.For example incomplete or incorrect requirements will lead to incorrect design, and that design will make it to an incorrectly developed and missing software feature.
Fixed Scope - Many traditional waterfall projects have fixed scope, because you tend to freeze the scope of one phase before starting the next.
Comprehensive system documentation - Processes and final product are generally very well documented in a waterfall project.

Whats wrong with Waterfall?
    1. Late delivery of business value: Customer doesnt get to see the product ubefore the early testing phase, which is usually two thirds the way through the product time line. You could be in the development and maintenance phase before you realize the product you were building was no longer viable due to change in market conditions, or organizational direction or changed computer landscape, or the product had a major architectural flaw that prevented it fro mbeing deployed. Meaning the product could completely fail after lots of time and money had been spent.
    2. In software development, everything changes. Requirements, skills, people, environment, business rules, etc. and as time progresses you learn better techniques of doing things. Your stakeholders may need to change requirements to match changing organizational strategy or changing market conditions.The only thing guaranteed is change and the shown process to refine our work.
    3.Precedence of detailed checklists/control processes over people since it is very heavily dependent on judgment and creativity.
## Impact of Waterfall
Documentation and checklists - When waterfall projects began to fail, many organizations treated it as a failure in a production factory, so they tried to add more comprehensive documentation and checklists, howver they do not add direct value to takeholders and connot replace the need for iterative.
Applicability - The waterfall model may be suitable for very simple and small systems, ongoing maintenance phases and ongoing maintenance phases, and mission-critical systems where gates checks are necessary to avoid catastrophic failures.
    Applicable Scenarios:  
        Simple Systems
        Enhancements in ongoing maintenance
        Mission critical systems (gated phases required)
Domain Knowledge - The waterfall approach can work if the development team has a good domain knowledge and both business and technical stakeholders collaborate effectively.
More time should be spent on maneuvering working software features early and often, and while enlisting customer feedback. 

## Spiral Model
The Spiral model is an iterative software development approach that combines elements of both the waterfall and iterative development models. It focuses on risk management and iterative refinement of the software. Developed in 1986 by  Barry Boehm, one of earliest models to propose iterative development; includes a mix of water and iterative approaches.
    1. Planning: To identify requirements and stakeholders, and to define lifecycle objectives and win conditions for the project.
    2. Risk Analysis: Risk-Identification, Risk prioritization and mitigation. Youll build prototypes to address risks and explore alternative solutions. 
    3. Engineering: To perform software implementation activities such as detailed design, coding, unit testing, and deployment. Early iterations may involve simple prototype, while late iterations may produce complete solutions.
    4. Evaluation: Get stakeholder review and feedback. Plan the next iteration on the evaluation.
Each iteration buiilds on the output of the previous one, allowing for continuous refinement and risk management throughout the development process.

## Rational Unified Process(RUP) Overview
Rational Unified Process(RUP) is a comprehensive iterative software development process developed by rational software. It includes artifacts, processes, templates, phases and disciplines. It has  detailed documentation, guidelines, sample artifacts, and deliverables. RUP is influenced by object-oriented analysis, design, and the Unified Modeling Language(UML). Its tailored to fit small, medium, and large software systems using plugins and consists of four phases, each ending with a milestone. 
The Phases of RUP include:
    1. Inception: To define the project scope and objectives, to achieve the "Lifecycle objectives milestone", where stakeholders agree on what to build.
    2. Elaboration: Baseline the architecture of the software system. Reach the "Lifecycle Architecture Milestone".
    3. Construction: Develop the software product, and to achieve the "Initial Operational Capability Milestone", Where the product is ready for use by end users.
    4. Transition: Fine tune the application for production. Reach the "Production Release Milestone", making the software fully usable at production scale.
Each phase includes one or more iterations and activies that are grouped into disciplines such as business modeling, requirements, analysis and design, implementation, testing, deployment, configuration, and change management, project management, and environment.

## Rational Unified Process: Life Cycle
Best practices of RUP Principles include:
    1. Iterative Development
    2. Managing requirements and changes
    3. continuously verifying quality
    4. visual modeling
    5. component-based architecture
Shortcomings
    1. Customizable but heavy - heavy process with alot of documentation, was disliked because it was thought to be needed to be followed religiously and implement all processes and artifacts.
    2. Prescriptive
