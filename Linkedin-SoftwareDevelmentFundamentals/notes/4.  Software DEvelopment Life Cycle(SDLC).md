# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
# Traditional Methods
## Waterfall model: Brief overview
Waterfall model follows a linear and sequential approach, meaning each phases output becomes the input for the next.
    Requirements: Capture all requirements for the project. Involves gathering and documenting what is needed from the software
    Analysis and Design: Produce high-level design and test specifications. Focuses on creating the architecture and design of the software including how it will be tested
    Development: Building the Software System. Where the actual coding and development of the software take place.
    Test: Matching the output of the system with the exppecting outputs defined in the test specifications. Involves verifying and validating that the software works as intended and meets     requirements.
    Development and Maintenance: Deploying the application to production and continue ongoing maintenance.This phase includes releasing the software to users and performing any necessary maintenance and updates.
Errors propagate to all other phases.For example incomplete or incorrect requirements will lead to incorrect design, and that design will make it to an incorrectly developed and missing software feature.
Fixed Scope - Many traditional waterfall projects have fixed scope, because you tend to freeze the scope of one phase before starting the next.
Comprehensive system documentation - Processes and final product are generally very well documented in a waterfall project.

Whats wrong with Waterfall?
    1. Late delivery of business value: Customer doesnt get to see the product ubefore the early testing phase, which is usually two thirds the way through the product time line. You could be in the development and maintenance phase before you realize the product you were building was no longer viable due to change in market conditions, or organizational direction or changed computer landscape, or the product had a major architectural flaw that prevented it fro mbeing deployed. Meaning the product could completely fail after lots of time and money had been spent.
    2. In software development, everything changes. Requirements, skills, people, environment, business rules, etc. and as time progresses you learn better techniques of doing things. Your stakeholders may need to change requirements to match changing organizational strategy or changing market conditions.The only thing guaranteed is change and the shown process to refine our work.
    3.Precedence of detailed checklists/control processes over people since it is very heavily dependent on judgment and creativity.
## Impact of Waterfall
Documentation and checklists - When waterfall projects began to fail, many organizations treated it as a failure in a production factory, so they tried to add more comprehensive documentation and checklists, howver they do not add direct value to takeholders and connot replace the need for iterative.
Applicability - The waterfall model may be suitable for very simple and small systems, ongoing maintenance phases and ongoing maintenance phases, and mission-critical systems where gates checks are necessary to avoid catastrophic failures.
    Applicable Scenarios:  
        Simple Systems
        Enhancements in ongoing maintenance
        Mission critical systems (gated phases required)
Domain Knowledge - The waterfall approach can work if the development team has a good domain knowledge and both business and technical stakeholders collaborate effectively.
More time should be spent on maneuvering working software features early and often, and while enlisting customer feedback. 

## Spiral Model
The Spiral model is an iterative software development approach that combines elements of both the waterfall and iterative development models. It focuses on risk management and iterative refinement of the software. Developed in 1986 by  Barry Boehm, one of earliest models to propose iterative development; includes a mix of water and iterative approaches.
    1. Planning: To identify requirements and stakeholders, and to define lifecycle objectives and win conditions for the project.
    2. Risk Analysis: Risk-Identification, Risk prioritization and mitigation. Youll build prototypes to address risks and explore alternative solutions. 
    3. Engineering: To perform software implementation activities such as detailed design, coding, unit testing, and deployment. Early iterations may involve simple prototype, while late iterations may produce complete solutions.
    4. Evaluation: Get stakeholder review and feedback. Plan the next iteration on the evaluation.
Each iteration buiilds on the output of the previous one, allowing for continuous refinement and risk management throughout the development process.

## Rational Unified Process(RUP) Overview
Rational Unified Process(RUP) is a comprehensive iterative software development process developed by rational software. It includes artifacts, processes, templates, phases and disciplines. It has  detailed documentation, guidelines, sample artifacts, and deliverables. RUP is influenced by object-oriented analysis, design, and the Unified Modeling Language(UML). Its tailored to fit small, medium, and large software systems using plugins and consists of four phases, each ending with a milestone. 
The Phases of RUP include:
    1. Inception: To define the project scope and objectives, to achieve the "Lifecycle objectives milestone", where stakeholders agree on what to build.
    2. Elaboration: Baseline the architecture of the software system. Reach the "Lifecycle Architecture Milestone".
    3. Construction: Develop the software product, and to achieve the "Initial Operational Capability Milestone", Where the product is ready for use by end users.
    4. Transition: Fine tune the application for production. Reach the "Production Release Milestone", making the software fully usable at production scale.
Each phase includes one or more iterations and activies that are grouped into disciplines such as business modeling, requirements, analysis and design, implementation, testing, deployment, configuration, and change management, project management, and environment.

## Rational Unified Process: Life Cycle
Best practices of RUP Principles include:
    1. Iterative Development
    2. Managing requirements and changes
    3. continuously verifying quality
    4. visual modeling
    5. component-based architecture
Shortcomings
    1. Customizable but heavy - heavy process with alot of documentation, was disliked because it was thought to be needed to be followed religiously and implement all processes and artifacts.
    2. Prescriptive


# Early Agile Methods
## Dynamic Systems Development Method(DSDM)
Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is an agile project delivery framework that was developed in 1994 to provide structure to Rapid Application Development(RAD) while maintaining agility. DSDM emphasizes an iterative and incremental approach to building software. Activities are assigned a maximum time limit, which cannot be extended ensuring focus and avoiding unnecessary refinements(timeboxing). Requirements are categorized into Must Have, Should Have, Could have, and Wont Have(MoSCoW Priorization). 
The 8 key principles of Dynamic Systems Development Method(DSDM) are:
    1. Focus on the business need: To ensure the project delivers real business benefits
    2. Deliver on time: Timeboxing ensures timely delivery
    3. Collaborate: Effective collaboration between all stakeholders
    4. Never compromise quality: Maintain high standards of quality throughout
    5. Build incrementaly from firm foundations: Develop the system in small, manageable incremenets
    6. Develop Iteratively: Use iterative development to refine and improve the system
    7. Communicate Continuously and clearly: Ensure clear and continuous communication among all team members
    8. Demonstrate Control: Maintain a highly visible plan and manage dilligently to stay on track
The Phases of the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) Life Cycle are:
    1. Pre-Project Phase: Projects are identified and funding commitments are made at the portfolio and executive management level
    2. Project Life Cycle Phase: 
        a. Feasability: Additional feasibility analysis is conducted
        b. Foundations: Detailed planning analysis to establish a solid foundation
        c. Evolutionary Development: The system is built in an iterative and incremental manner
        d. Deployment: The system is deployed to the users
    3. Post-Project Phase: Evalutate if the expected benefits have been realized and look for ways to improve based on what went well and what did not during the project execution.
These phases ensure a structured yet flexible approach to project delivery.

## Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
A feature is a piece of working functionality that has business value and is typically expressed as action, result, object.
Feature-Driven Development (FDD) is a lightweigth and agile process where software is viewed as a collection of working features, each providing business value. Feature-Driven Development(FDD) focuses on delivering working software composed of these features through an iterative process. Its structured, feature-focused, and iterative.
Feature-Centric Approach: Software is seen as a collection of working features, each with business values.
Five Steps of Feature-Driven Development (FDD) include: 
    1. Develop Overall Model: Create a high-level initial domain model.
    2. Build Feature List: Divide the domain into subject areas and identify features.
    3. Plan by feature: Prioritize features and develop an implementation plan
    4. Design by feature: Add details to the domain model and create sequence diagrams.
    5. Build by feature: implement, test, inspect, and deploy the features
Team Organization: Teams are organized around features, allowing parallel work and efficient integration
Tracking Completion: Feature-Driven Development(FDD) uses milestones with assigned completion percentages to track progress.

## Crystal Methods Overview
Crystal method refers to a family of methodologies developed by Alistair Cockburn in the 1990s. These methodologies are people-centric, lightweigth, and highly flexible, and they vary based on team size and the criticality of the product being built.
Family of Methodologies: Crystal methods include various methodologies each represented by a color, chosen based on team size and product criticality.
    Crystal Clear: For small teams with low criticality
    Crystal Orange: For larger teams with higher criticality
Criticality and Team Size: The Y-axis represents criticality(severity of damage caused by system malfunction), and the X-axis represents team size.
People-Centric: Crystal methods prioritize people's interactions, effective communication, and collaboration over formal processes.
Frequent Delivery: Emphasize frequent delivery of working software and reflective improvement
Flexibility: The approach is highly flexible, and adapting to different project needs and risks.


# Modern Approaches
## Scrum Overview
Scrum is the most popular and widely adopted agile framework designed for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It's lightweight and consists of a few roles, events and artifacts. 
The 3 Scrum Roles are:
    1. Product Owner: Owns the product backlog, individual
    2. Scrum Master: Agile Coach, guide/mentor who teaches the scrum team, scrum rules, and practices, and facilitates scrum events if necessary. leader who removes barriers, and does not manage development team
    3. Development Team members: Name given to scrum team members, such as developers, testers, documenters, Database Administrators(DBAs), and so forth. Cross-functional  and self-organizing
Events include:
    1. Sprints(short iterations)
    2. Daily scrum meetings
    3. Sprint Reviews
Artifacts include:
    1. Product backlog(list of all to-do items)
    2. Sprint backlog(subset of items for the current sprint)
    3. Product increment(working software produced at the end of each sprint)
Scrum emphasizes a small, cross-functional team working in short iterations to create working software. The scrum guide is a key resource for understanding scrum in detail and is available at scrumguides.org

## Scrum workflow
Sprint Planning is an event where the scrum team comes together to decide which items from the product backlog will be worked on during the incoming sprint. The Team drats a sprint goal which is a high-level business objective for the sprint. The development team creates an initial plan on how to implement the selected items.

Daily Scrum is a 15-minute timeboxed event for the development team to sync up and measure progress towards the sprint goal. 
Team members typically answer three questions:
    1. What did you do since the last Daily Scrum.
    2. What are you planning to do today?
    3. Are there any impediments to your progress
This event is not a status meeting, but is a chance for the team to ensure they are on track.

Scrum Teams work incrementally and iteratively, starting with Sprint Planning and ending with a Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective. The Development team meets daily in the daily scrum to ensure alignment and progress. At the end of each sprint, a product increment is produced and reviewed. The sprint Retrospective focuses on improving processes, team communication, tools, and skills, highlighting the importance of collaboration and continuous improvement.

## Lean Overview and key concepts
Lean Software Development is a collection of principles centered on the key tenet to minimize waste; originating from the Toyota Production System (TPS) post-WW2 focusing on reducing waste and manufacturing with optimal efficiency. Lean Software development aims to minimize waste through processes that visualize the production pipline and identify inefficiencies. 

## Lean Value Stream Mapping
Lead Time: The total time taken from customer request to produce/service delivery. For example, if you order a pizza and it arrives in 45minuites, that is the lead time.
Cycle Time: A subset of lead time, representing the duration of time when actual work is performed on the produced. In the pizza example, this would include the time spent baking and packaging the pizza.
Value Stream Mapping (VSM): A technique used to visualize the workflow and identify areas for improvement. It helps in spotting inefficiencies and reducing lead time to match cycle time.

In summary, VSM is used to improve business processes by identifying and minimizing waste.
