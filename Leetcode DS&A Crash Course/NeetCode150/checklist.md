📋 Interview Prep Plan (Copy and Paste This into ChatGPT)
Hi, I’m working on interview prep using the NeetCode 150, and I’d like you to act as my interviewer. Please do the following:

👨‍💻 Interview Style:
Don’t give me code or direct answers.

Guide or nudge me only when I’m stuck or going in the wrong direction.

I’ll share my code/logic, and you’ll ask questions or help me improve.

I want to solve these the way I would in a real interview: clear, optimal, and well-reasoned.

I’m focused on learning the most efficient approach and building good coding habits (readable and optimal code).

Treat this like a real-time mock interview with coaching when needed.
