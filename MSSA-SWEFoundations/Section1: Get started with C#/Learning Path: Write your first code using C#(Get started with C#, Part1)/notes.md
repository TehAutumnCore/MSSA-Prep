# Introduction - What is C# is used for?
    business applications to capture, analyze, and process data
    Dynamic web applications that can be accessed from a web browser
    Games, both 2D and 3D
    Financial and scientific applications
    Cloud-based applications
    Mobile Applications

C# is case-sensitive language
common errors could include:
    Entering lower-case letters instead of capitalizing C in Console, or the letters W or L in WriteLine
    Entering a comma instead of a period between Console and WriteLine
    Forgetting to use double-quotation marks, or using single-quotation marks to surround the phrase Hello World!
    Forgetting a semi-colon at the end of the command

Compilation: a special program called a compiler converts your source code into a different format that the computers central processing unit can execute. When code is run using the green Run button, the code written was first compiled then executed.Compilers bridges communication between humans and computers by translating human-readable instructions into a computer-understandable set of instructions.

Syntax: rules for running code, like human languages with punctuation and sentence structure. They define the keywords and operators of C# and how they put together to form programs. The subtle changes of color to different words and symbols is Syntax highlighting. This is a feature that helps spot mistakes in the code. 

Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
When a phrase is surrounded by double quotation marks in c# code its referred to as a literal string. In other words, you LITERALLY want the characters 'H','e','l','l','o' and so on sent to the output.

The Console part is called a class. Classes "own" methods, such as methods live inside of a class. followed by invoking the method by using parentheses after the methods name, lastly followed by the method invocation operator.
Console.WriteLine -> class.method("Method Invocation Operator"); <-semi colon is the end of statement operator

Difference between Console.WriteLine and Console.Write is Console.WriteLine appends a new line after the output.
