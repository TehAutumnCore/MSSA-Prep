# 4 Pillars of OOP
## Encapsulation
Encapsulation: Binding together pieces of code and keep it obscure to prevent outside changes

## Inheritance
Inheritance: Basing one type(or clasS) on another type allowing us to re-use pre-written code.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism: Present the same type (or class) but the definitions of members perform differently

## Abstraction
Abstraction: Penultimate use of all 3 pillars. Offers an indirect usage of encapsulated code, provides a class to inherit from,                                                                 and provides no specific action or data, just defines the members.
