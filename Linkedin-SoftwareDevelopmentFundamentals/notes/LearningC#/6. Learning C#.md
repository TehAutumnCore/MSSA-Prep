# Overview of C#
## Hello World C#
Creating a Console App:
    dotnet new console
Understanding Program Structure:
    namespaces: Helps organize code and prevent name conflicts, They group related classes, interfaces, and functions together. For example, using System; indicates that the program will use code from the .Net System namespace. 
    classes: Building blocks of C# programs, they define objects, and their behaviors. The Program class contains the code for your application.
    Main function:The Entry point of a C# console application. When the program starts, it looks for the Main Funciton to begin execution. Is is defined as 
    static void main(string[] args)
Basic Input and Output: 
    Console.WriteLine to print text to the console 
    Console.ReadLine to read user input
Simplifying Code: Introduction to top-level statements in C# 9 to reduce boiletplate code for simple applications

Top-level statements in C#: Allow you to write simple programs without the usual boiletplate code like namespaces, clases, and the Main method. Instead, you can write your code directly in the file. For example, instead of the boilet plate code below you can write: Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); since the compiler implicitly handles the usual boiler plate code behind the scenes which allows for simpler, and more concise code for small applications or scripts without worrying about the extra structure.

<!-- 
See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
For .NET 5 and earlier, the console app template generates the following code:
 dotnet new console

using System;
namespace MyApp
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
} 
-->

## Variables and data types
Data Types: C# uses specific data types for variables, such as integers, floating-point numbers, decimals, Booleans, characters and strings.
Variable Declaration: Unlike some other languages, C# requires you to specify the type of variable when declaring it, which helps reduce programming errors.
Var Keyword: You can use the var keyword to let the compiler infer the type of the variable.
    int i = 10;
    float f = 2.0f;
    decimal d = 10.0m;
    bool b = true;
    char c = 'c';
    string str = "This is a string"
    var x = 10;
    var y = "Hello!"
Arrays: Arrays can be declared using square brackets and can be initialized with values using curly braces.
    int[] values = new int[5];
    string[] strs = {"one","two","three"};
Null Values: A variable can be assigned a null value, indicating it has no value.
    object obj = null;
Type Conversion: C# allows implicit and explicit type conversions between compatible data types.
    <!-- Implicitly Converting-->
    long bignum;   <!--Long indicates a large number-->
    bignum = i     
    <!-- Explicitly Converting -->
    float i_to_f = (float)i;
    Console.WriteLine($"integer_to_float", {i_to_f});
    
    int f_to_i = (int)f;
    Console.WriteLine($"float_to_integer", {f_to_i});

## Operators
Basic Math Operators: C# supports basic math operations like addition(+), subtraction(-),multiplication(*), and division(/). You can also use shorthand operators like ++ for increment, and -- for decrement.
String Operation: You can concatenate strings using the + operator.
Logical Operators: Logical operators like &&(AND) and || (OR) are used to evaluate Boolean Expressions.
Null Coalescing Operators: The ?? operator returns the left-hand operand if it is not null, otherwise, it returns the right-hand operand, it returns the right-hand operand. The ??= operator assigns a value to a variable only if it is null.

## Comments
Single Line Comments: Use // to write single line comments, which are useful for brief notes
Multi-Line Comments: Use /**/ to write comments that span muiltiple lines, ideal for longer explainations.
XML Documentation Comments: Use /// to create XML documentation comments, which can be used to automatically generate documentation from your code. These comments can include tags like <summary>, <param>, and <returns>.
    <!--
    <PropertyGroup>
        <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
        <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
        <GenerateDocumentationFile>True</GenerateDocumentationFile> Will Generate a documention file
        <DocumentationFile>Comments.xml</DocumentationFile> The documentation file will be named Comments.xml
    </PropertyGroup>
    You can then run dotnet build at the comments.xml amd it will generate documentation.
    --------------------------// Documentation Example below-----------------------------
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <doc>
    <assembly>
        <name>Comments</name>
    </assembly>
    <members>
        <member name="M:Comments.Program.Main(System.String[])">
            XML Comments are used to help provide documentation
            They start with triple-slashes and have a special syntax
            <summary>
            This is the main sample application function
            </summary>
            <param name='args'> An array of string arguments from the command line. </param>
            <returns>
            No return value
            </returns>
        </member>
    </members>
    </doc>

# C# Program Flow
## Conditionals with "if"
If Statement: Used to perform a logical decision based on a condition. If the condition is true, the code inside the curly baces is executed.
    if (theVal == 50) {
        Console.WriteLine("theVal is 50");
        }
Else and Else If: else provides an alternative block of code if the if condition is false. else if allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.
    if (theVal == 50) {
        Console.WriteLine("theVal is 50");
    } else if (theVal < 50) {
        Console.WriteLine("theVal is less than 50");
    } else {
        Console.WriteLine("theVal is more than 50");
    }
Ternary Operator: A shorthnad way to write simple if-else statements. 
It uses the syntax:     condition ? trueResult : falseResult.
    Console.WriteLine(theVal > 50 ? "theVal is small" : "theVal is large");

## Conditions with "switch"
Switch Statement Structure: The switch statement is used for making decisions based on the value of an expression. It includes switch(expression) followed by multiple case labels and a default label.
Case Labels: Each case label represents a possible value for the expression. When a match is found, the corresponding code block is executed, followed by a break statement to exit the switch.
Default Label: The default label acts as a catch-all for any values not matched by the case labels, ensuring all possible outcomes are handled.

## For Loops
For Loop Structure: A for loop in C# uses the for keyword, followed by intiialization, condition, and increment expressions inside paratheses. It repeats a block of code a specific number of times.
For-Each Loop: The for-each loop is used to iterate over sequences like arrays or collections. It simplifies processing each element in a sequence. 
Use Cases: For loops are ideal for scenarios where you know the number of iterations in advance, while for-each loops are useful for iterating through all elements in a collection.

## While Loops
While Loop: Executes a set of statements as long as a specified condition is true. The condition is checked before the loop runs.
Do-While Loop: Similar to the while loop but guarantees execution at least once because the condition is checked after the loop runs.


## Break and continue
Break Statement: Used to terminate a loop before the ending condition is reached. For example, it stops the loop when a certain condition is met, like finding a value greater than 40 in a list.
Continue Statement: Skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. For instance, it can be used to skip numbers in teh twenties while iterating over a list.

## Exceptions
Exception Handling: In c#, exceptions are used to handle errors gracefully, preventing them from reaching the user
Try and Catch Blocks: Use a try block to wrap code that might throw an exception and a catch block to handle the errors if it occurs.
Specific Exceptions: You can catch specific exceptions, such as DivideByZeroException, to handle different error types appropriately.
Finally Block: The finally block contains code that runs regardless of whether an exception was thrown, useful for cleaning up resources.

# C# Strings
## String operations
String Properties and Methods: C# strings are objects with properties like Length and methods such as concat, Join, IndexOf, and Replace.
Accessing Characters: You can access individual characters in a string using square brackets, similar to arrays.
String Comparisons: Use Compare for ordinal comparisons and Equals for checking equality.
String Manipulation: Methods like Concat and Join allow for combining  strings, while IndexOf and LastIndexOf help in searching within strings. The Replace method is used for replacing parts of a string.

## String Formatting
String Formatting Syntax: Using curly braces {} with index notation, including optional alignment values and format specifiers
Format Specifiers: Different format specifiers like N for general number, F for fixed-point, E for exponential, D for decimal, and C for currency are discussed. 
    General format is {index[,alignment]:[format]}
        Common types are N (Number), G (General), F (Fixed-point), 
        E (Exponential), D (Decimal), P (Percent), X (Hexadecimal),
        C (Currency in local format)
Precision and Alignment: The video demonstrates how to use precision specifiers to control the number of decimal places and alignment specifiers to format data into neatly aligned columns.
        double[] intlMixPct = {.386, .413, .421, .457};
        Console.WriteLine("$ {0,12:P0} {1,12:P0} {2,12:P1} {3,12:P2}", 
            intlMixPct[0],intlMixPct[1],intlMixPct[2],intlMixPct[3]);
    <!-- $         39 %         41 %       42.1 %      45.70 % -->

## String Interpolation
String Interpolation: Allows embedding variables and expressions directly into a string using the $ symbol outside the opening quote and curly braces {} for the variables.
Ease of Use: String interpolation makes the code more readable compared to using index placeholders.
Formatting: You can still use string formatting within interpolated strings, such as formatting a number as currency.
Expressions: You can include expressions inside the braces, such as calculations.
Literal Braces: To include literal curly braces in the string, use double braces {{ and }}

## StringBuilder
Efficiency: The StringBuilder class in C# is used for efficient string manipulation, avoiding the performance overhead of creating multiple immutable string objects.
Usage: You can initalize a StringBuilder with an initial string and a maximum capacity, and use methods like Append, AppendLine, AppendFormat, AppendJoin, Replace, and Insert to manipulate the string content
Properties: The StringBuilder has properties liek Capacity and Length to check its current capacity and the length of the string content
Final Output: Convert the StringBuilder content to a final string using the ToString method.

Capacity is the maximum number of characters that the StringBuilder can hold before it needs to allocate more memory.

## String Parsing
Parsing Strings: to take a string and parse it into C# data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, and Booleans using the Parse method.
Error Handling: Using try-catch blocks to handle exceptions that may occur during parsing.
TryParse Method: TryParse simplfies error handling by returning a boolean indicating whether the parsing succeeded, along with the parsed value using an out parameter

## Code Challenge: Determine the type of piece of data

// C# code​​​​​​‌‌​‌​​‌‌​​​​‌‌‌‌‌​‌‌​​‌​‌ below
using System;

// Write your answer here, and then test your code.
// Your job is to implement the findLargest() method.

public class Answer {
    // Change these Boolean values to control whether you see 
    // the expected result and/or hints.
    public  static Boolean ShowExpectedResult = true;
    public  static Boolean ShowHints = true;

    public static bool CountTheType(object Arg, string TypeToCount) {
        // Your code goes here. Return true if the type of the Arg is the same
        // as what the TypeToCount parameter says to count.
        if (Arg.GetType().ToString() == TypeToCount) {
            return true;
        } return false;
    }
}

# C# Functions
## Function Basics
Overview of C#: Understand the basics of C# language constructs such as program flow and data types.
Setting Up: Learn how to set up your development environment and run C# examples.
Coderpad Challenges: Hands on coding practice with interactive exercises to reinforce learning.

## Named and default parameters
Default Parameters: Assigning default values to function parameters directly in the function definition will allow you to call the function without specifcying those parameters, making the code more concise and readable.
Named Parameters: Can call functions using the names of the parameters which allows you to pass parameters in any order. This is especially useful when dealing with functions that have many parameters or default values, enhancing code readability.

## Reference and out parameters
Reference Parameters(ref): When you pass an argument with the ref keyword the function can modify the value of the argument, and the change will be reflected outside the function. This is because the argument is passed by reference, not by value. 
Output Parameters(out): The out keyword is used to return multiple values from a function. Parameters marked with out are intended to be modified by the function to return values to the caller. 
Usage: While ref allows a function to modify an arguments value, out is specifically for returning values. The video also mentions using tuples is a more modern approach for returning multiple values in C#.

## Returning multiple values
Out Parameters: The out keyword allows you to return values through function parameters, but it can make code harder to read and breaks the convention of using parameters to pass data to functions.
Tuples: Introduced in C# 7, tuples provide a clean and efficient way to return multiple values from a function. They grow multiple values together in a lightweight data structure.
Preferred Method: Using tuples is now the preferred way to return multiple values from a function, as it keeps the code cleaner and more readable compared to using out parameters. 

## Palidrome
// C# code​​​​​​‌‌​‌​‌​​​‌​‌‌‌​‌​‌​​​​‌​‌ below
using System;
using System.Text;

// Write your answer here, and then test your code.

public class Answer {

    // Change these Boolean values to control whether you see 
    // the expected result and/or hints.
   public  static Boolean ShowExpectedResult = false;
   public  static Boolean ShowHints = true;

    // Determine whether a string is a Palindrome
    public static bool IsPalindrome(string thestr) {
        // Your code goes here.
        StringBuilder cleaned = new StringBuilder();
        foreach(char c in thestr) {
            if (char.IsLetterOrDigit(c)) {
                cleaned.Append(char.ToLower(c));
            }

        }
        char[] CharArray = cleaned.ToString().ToCharArray();
        Array.Reverse(CharArray);
        string reversedStr = new string(CharArray);
        return cleaned.ToString() == reversedStr;
    }
}
