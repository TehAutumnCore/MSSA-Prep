# Learning C#
# Introduction
## Introduction to learning C#
C# has an expressive syntax with a powerful library in .NET runtime

Fundamentals of C#: Learn about basic language constructs like program flow, data types and operators.
Advanced Topics: Dive into function, object-oriented programming techniques and string processing
Hands-On Practice: Engage with interactive coding exercises through Code Challenges powered by Coderpad

## What you should know
familiar with basic programming concepts - Variables, functions, operators, logical operators, and so on
Object-oriented programming (classes, inheritance, and so on)
    Courses to help learn these concepts:
        Programming Foundations: Fundamentals
        Programming Foundations: Object-Oriented Design
Using programming tools like IDEs and the terminal
    Visual Studios

## Setting up the Environment
Installing .NET:
<!-- # Download the Microsoft package repository configuration for the current Ubuntu version -->
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/$(lsb_release -rs)/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
<!-- # Install the downloaded Microsoft package repository configuration -->
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
<!-- # Remove the downloaded .deb file to clean up -->
rm packages-microsoft-prod.deb
<!-- # Update the package lists to include the newly added Microsoft repository -->
sudo apt-get update
<!-- # Install apt-transport-https package to allow APT to fetch packages over HTTPS -->
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
<!-- # Install the .NET SDK version 8.0 -->
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-8.0
<!-- # Verify the .NET SDK installation by checking the installed version -->
dotnet --version

## How to run the examples
dotnet run
<!-- dotnet run {works if you're at the top level of the project} 
 with pwd you're at directory: /home/desktop/MSSA-prep/Linkedin-SoftwareDevelopmentFundamentals/notes/LearningC#/LearningCSharp/DotNet7/Finished/Overview/HelloWorld
 
with ls you can see
HelloWorld.csproj  Program.cs  bin  obj 
then you use dotnet run


Script to change the target framework within every .csproj file from DotNet7.0 to DotNet8.0. Run it at the same level of the Finished and Start Directories!
find . -name "*.csproj" -exec sed -i 's|<TargetFramework>.*</TargetFramework>|<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>|g' {} +

# Overview of C#
## Hello World C#
Creating a Console App:
    dotnet new console
Understanding Program Structure:
    namespaces: Helps organize code and prevent name conflicts, They group related classes, interfaces, and functions together. For example, using System; indicates that the program will use code from the .Net System namespace. 
    classes: Building blocks of C# programs, they define objects, and their behaviors. The Program class contains the code for your application.
    Main function:The Entry point of a C# console application. When the program starts, it looks for the Main Funciton to begin execution. Is is defined as 
    static void main(string[] args)
Basic Input and Output: 
    Console.WriteLine to print text to the console 
    Console.ReadLine to read user input
Simplifying Code: Introduction to top-level statements in C# 9 to reduce boiletplate code for simple applications

Top-level statements in C#: Allow you to write simple programs without the usual boiletplate code like namespaces, clases, and the Main method. Instead, you can write your code directly in the file. For example, instead of the boilet plate code below you can write: Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); since the compiler implicitly handles the usual boiler plate code behind the scenes which allows for simpler, and more concise code for small applications or scripts without worrying about the extra structure.

<!-- 
See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
For .NET 5 and earlier, the console app template generates the following code:
 dotnet new console

using System;
namespace MyApp
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
