# Internet Basics

ARPANET: Advanced Research Projects Agency Network Established in 1969 by the department of defense. 

Packets:  a blocks of information sent from one point of the network to another. 

Standard Networking Procol: TCP/IP
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): 
Internet Protocol (IP):

Tim Berners-Lee created an application called the World Wide Web, later renamed to Nexus at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, or Cern. He created the first web browser that allowed a user to navigate through pages of information using links to connect phrases to additional pages. 

Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP)
Hypertext Markup Language(HTML)
httpd: very first web server

The High-Performance Computing Act was created and introduced by Senator Al Gore which lead to the funding of new technologies, including Mosaic, the first commercially successful web browser that capitalized on the commercialization 

Standards Bodies
Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, which owns the rules for various languages like HTML, CSS, SVG, and more but is a slow organization. Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group(WHATWG): continues to develop HTML as a living standard.

the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers(ICANN): Nonprofit that organizes the various terms and phrases used to connect web addresses such as .com, .net, .ca, .uk, with the numeric protocols of the web

The Internet is maintained by a combination of government agencies, international groups, and companies in the private sector to keep the fundamental technologies of the internet working.

The internet is formed of multiple networks that all conform to the standard internet procols of the internet known as TCPIP.

International Air Transport Association(IATA) developed a system of three letter codes that every airport throughout the world has adopted.

ICANN does the same thing for the internet, using Uniform Resource Locations(URLs)

# Addressing and Routing Information
## Sending and receiving information
Packets say where they come from like a return address on an envelope and where its going to. If the packet is being sent to somewhere that doesn't exist or theres a problem, theres a way for the network to send a message back to the sender. The packet also needs to say how long it is by defining the number of bytes that are in the packet. finally need to know how many packets are in the overall message and in which place each individual packet lives within the set.

## The Internet Protocol and IP Address
The use of numbers as addresses is called the Internet Protocol or IP. Each device on the device has an IP address.
IPv4 is a sequence of 3 digit numbers seperated by a period such as 123.45.67.89. Each number can be a number from 0-255.
Each packet has the sender and receiver in the header. These are stored as IP adresses. 

There are private and public addresses and the IANA establishes what number sets are assigned to different groups. 
Private addresses can start with 192,172,or 10, while public addresses can start with 123, 24, or 89.

## Scaling up the internet from IPv4 to IPv6
IPv6 was created due to IPv4's four billion limit. 
IPv4 uses 32 bit, IPv6 uses 128 bits with a limit of 340 undecillion.

Dual Stack: Where IPv4 and IPv6 are supported at the same time allowing devices to work regardless if the hardware is updated or not

## The Domain Name Server and DNS

The Domain name is a sequence of phrases that map to a giant internet-wide database of IP addresses
Domain Name Server holds a lot of domain names and their matching IP addresses. There are many
DNS name resolution: The process of translating a domain name to an IP address
top-level domain: the last part of the domain such as .com, some use two letter country codes such as www.bbc.co.uk
host name: the middle part of teh domain before the .com such as google in google.com
webserver subname is before the host name such as www. or smtp. or ftp. such as www. in www.google.com

## Routers and directing requests
The internet is an incredibly complex system of servers and routers where a packet navigates through tons of these.
A router has a component called the configuration table which is a set of commands that defines how the router works

## Packets and fault tolerance 
A packet consists of about a kilobyte of information but if you're sending a long email, an audio file, or an image that would require that the data is broken down into dozens or even hundreds of packets of more.
Pinging a server will allow you see how packets navigate the internet in milliseconds where youll receive a report of how many packets were sent, and how many were received back and how many were lost in the internet for some reason

Fault Tolerance: Being able to navigate through various conditions on the internet, being able to reroute packets in different ways if something were to happen along its path.

## Reliability and TCP

Transmission Control Protocol(TCP): Audits a message and reviews it in order to put it together in the right way, where it uses a process where it looks at all the packets in a message and checks them
In TCP/IP, TCP focuses on reliability where User Datagram Protocol(UDP) focuses on speed.

# Web Servers
## Identifying a server with URLs
A DNS server is able to resolve the wors used to identify the host into the IP address for that specific server. Can change the subname to lead to different IP addresses such as www., dev., prod., beta.

In a DNS there are records, called A records(address record) and CNAME records which store rules for how domains are translated to IP addresses.
A record(address record): The IP address that we want to map to the full url
canonical name record: created on the same dns, where it lists the URL name that is requested and what the URL name should be redirected to.

## HTTP and requests
Most common type of requests are GET and POST.
The GET request asks for the web server to return back information in the form of a header; or information that describes a configuration and the body which is the content of the file that is requested. When the server daemon hears the request for a specific webpage like index.html for www.gary.com and then sends information back using two sections. The header which contains the type of data being sent back, it defines the type of server, the current date, language and response code. The response code indicates if the get request was successful or not.
response code 200: get request was successful
response code 404: information requested could not be found, and sends that back 
Second part is the response body which is the content of the document you asked for which in most cases is HTML.

The Post Request is when you send information to the server to use. This could be information such as with an web form and click the submit button to send to the server. 
The server will hear the request and accept the data in teh request and send a response back as a header and body.

## Hypertext and HTML
HTML works by taking a section of text and wrapping certain sections of it with tags. Tags are unique Combinations of letters and characters that denote the beginning and end of certain sections. such as <h1>Apple</h1>, <img src="apple.ong">, or <a>pear</a>. Links use Anchor(a) tags where inbetween the tags will define additional information for the tag to work. The link is wherever is assigned/saved in the HREF property. <a href="pear.html">pear</a

## Remembering requests with cookies
everytime you open the browser and open a web page, its a unique request as if you've never visited the website before. Many sites may require you to log into an account. The time you're on a site, is called a session. As you're on a site during your session there are things you can do to configure the site. When you close the browser you end the session, and the information is lost. Browser cookes remember the bits about your browser sessions to make it easier to work with various websites. 
When you try to login the browser will ask you for your username and password when that is entered the site tells the browser that it can save the username as a cookie. 
So when you close and reopen the site, the cookie will be sent to the site with the HTTP reques and when you try to login again itll remember your username and automatically remember to fill that in for you. 

Another use of cookies is to maintain consistency with a site within a session. If you go to a website to buy something, youll add the item to the shopping cart on the online store, and if you browse to another page the browser and site will need to know that I'm the owner of the cart. So a random identifier will be created, and is saved as a cookie. That way when you go to another page of the site, the server will be able to use your identification code in the cookie with the corresponding shopping cart. 

Cookies can also be used to track browsing habits, for instance if you go to a website for the first time the site can tell your browser to create a unique code for you to save as a cookie, so the next time you go to that website it knows youre a returning visitor than a new visitor and may show you something different than it may when you're visiting there for the first time. 

## Securing requests with SSL and TLS
Secure Sockets Layer(SSL): Is an early layer of security that was created by netscape and is now part of the overall system security of TLS today. 
Transport Layer Security(TLS): When TLS is being used you will see a lock icon in the browser window or you will see https(secured) instead of simply http. It creates and verifies the connection from the client to the server and then creates and verifies the connection from the server to the client, also known as handshaking. This way TLS can secure the data being sent in both directions. When it encrypts the message it is still able to preserve the header of the packets that will be used to transport the data since this all needs to work on the TCP/IP protocol.

Authentication is done by using a security certificate which is granted by an unknown security entity that verifies that the companies, servers, and networks are who they say they are. This certificate contains the domain name, the public key used to encrypt, the owner, and the issue date and when it expires. 

# Encryption
## Caesar's cypher and keys
If you put the alphabet and put it on a flip dial, youll have a collection of 26 letters where each letter corresponds with the number of its place in the alphabet.
you can add or remove as many cypers as youd like. 

## Improving security with longer keys
With caesar cypher, with a name like Gary you can do +2,+5,+2,+5 so not all letters are +2 for more security with caesar cypher. With more bits you add to the key, the more complex it becomes to solve, however for a computer, itd be able to crank through millions of possibilities in seconds therefore resulting in needing to think much bigger. 

Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) is a standard of how electronic data is encrypted in the US and is recognized world wide. AES is based on a cipher called the Rijndael where the information is organized in a four-by-four matrix of bytes where each matrix has a unique key that either substitues values, shifts rows, or mixes columns to scramble messages.

## Symmetric and asymmetric keys 
Symmetric Security: Where both sides of the message agree on what the key is and will be applied to the message before its sent.

Asymmetric Security: where one key is with the sender that will be able to encrypt and send information but not be able to decrypt while the other key is only on the receiver's end and can only be used to decrypt all the information that it receives.

Public keys can be exchanged and shared but only work in one way, while the private key is the only way a message can be decrypted but is never shared since it can be used to crack any coded message sent to the server.
