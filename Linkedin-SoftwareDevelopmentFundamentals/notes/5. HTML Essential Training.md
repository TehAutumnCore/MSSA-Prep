# HTML Essential Training

## Languages of the web
The web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 to share information without emails. It started with text-based documents and has evolved significantly. 
Front-end Languages control what you see in a browser which includes:
    Hhypertext Markup Language (HTML)
    CSS
    Javascript 
Back-end languages handle server-side functionality and may include 
    PHP
    Ruby
    Ruby
    Java
    Python
Full-Stack Development is the lines between front-end and back-end development have blurred with Javascript frameworks like Node.js, React, and Angular Leading to the rise of full-stack developers. 
Full-Stack Developers: Someone who work with both front-end and back-end technologies.

## Anatomy of a website
Website Structure: A website consists of a collection of files and folders, including content, code, style sheets, images, and more all organized in a root folder with subfolders for better organization.
    RootFolder: The main folder that contains all the files for the website
    HTML Files: Stored in the root folder with the .html extension
    Subfolders: Used to organize related files(e.g.,images,CSS, Javascript).
        CSS Files: Typically stored in a subfolder with the .css extension
        Javascript Files: Typically stored in a subfolder with the .js extension
        Media Files: Images, videos, and audio files can be stored in their respective subfolders
Naming Conventions: Use hyphens instead of spaces, all lowercase letters, and meaningful, descriptive names for files to avoid errors and improve SEO.
    Avoiding spaces in file names; use hyphens(-) or underscores(_).
    Use all lowercase letters
    Use short, meaningful, and descriptive names
Single Vs. Multi-Page Websites: Websites can be single-page, with content in one HTML file, or multi-page, with multiple HTML pages linked together.

## The Rules of the web
W3C and HTML standards: The WorldWide Web Consortium (W3C) estbablishes and maintains guidelines for for writing HTML and CSS. They partnered with the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group in 2019 to manage HTML standards.
Resource for Learning: You don't need to read all the documentation to learn HTML. Useful resources include caniuse.com for checking browser support, the W3C HTML Validator for checking code, and the Mozilla Developer Network for easier to read documentation.
Learning Process: It's important to explore, practice, and give yourself time to learn HTML. Checking publish dates on resources ensures you're using up-to-date information.

## Terminology and syntax
The following points will help write and maintain clean and well structured HTML code.
HTML Basics: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to structure and add meaning to content on webpages.
HTML Tags: Tags are used to create elements in HTML. They consist of an opening tag, content, and closing tag. Some tags are self-closing.
    <tagname>Content here</tagname>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>
    <header>
        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>   
    </header>
    <section>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    </section>
    Void/Self-ClosingElements: do not require a closing tag, theyre for content(<hr>) and used to embed web resources(<img>).

Attributes: Attributes provide additional information or functionality to HTML elements and are included in the opening tag. Boolean attribute do not require a value
    <tag attribute="value"></tag>
    <tag attribute></tag>
    <tag attribute="value" attribute></tag>

Comments: HTML comments can be added to the code for documentation and organization purposes and are not displayed in the bbrwoser.
<!-- This is a comment -->
<!-- 
This 
is a 
comment 
-->

# Formatting Text
## Paragraphs and headings
Paragraphs: Use the <p> tag to format sentences into paragraphs. The browser automatically adds space between paragraphs for visual seperation.
Headings: There are six heading tags, from <h1> to <h6>, used to define a hierarchy. <h1> is the most significant, and <h6> is the least. 
Semantic Structure: Proper use of headings helps organize content and is important for accessibility, as it creates an outline that screen readers can use.

## Ordered, unordered, and description lists
Types of lists in HTML: 
    ordered lists (<ol>) can use start="#" so the bullets start from that number, can use type="a" for the bullets to be lowercase letters or "A" for capital letters or "I" for romain numerals
    unordered lists (<ul>)
    description lists (<dl>)

List Items are all written using the <li> tag.
    ordered lists (<ol>)
    unordered lists (<ul>)
    description list (<dl>)
        description term(<dt>)
        description (<dd>)

        <dl>
            <dt>(Term HTML)</dt>
            <dd>(definition) A markup language used to structure content for the web </dd>
        </dl>

Attributes and Nesting: Ordered lists can have attributes like start and type to customize numbering. Unordered lists use CSS for styling. Lists can be nested within each other for subcategories

## Quotations
Block Quote and Cite Elements: Use <blockquote> tag for quotations with the text wrapped in <p> tags. The <cite> tag is used for the title of the work, not for the person's name.
Inline Quotes: For short quotes within a sentence use the <q> tag, which automatically adds curly quotation marks.
Cite Attribute: The cite attribute can be added to the <blockquote> or <q> tags to provide a URL for the source, which is not displayed in the browser but helps with metadata.

## Date and time 
Usage of <time> Element: The <time> element is used to define a specific period in time, with the content displayed between the tags.
Datetime Attribute: The datetime attribute formats the date into a machine-readable format which can include time on a 24-hour clock, calender dates, or durations
Formats: There are various formats for defining time (hours, minutes, seconds) and dates(year,month,day) as well as combining dates and times. The full list of valid datetime values can be found on the MDN docs.

<time> March 1, 2025</time>
<time> 6:20 p.m.</time>
<time> One hour ago</time>

Time Values
HH:MM
HH:MM:SS
HH:MM:SS:mmm
<time datetime="18:20">6:20 p.m.</time>

Date Values
YYYY-MM
YYYY-MM-DD
MM-DD
<time datetime="2025-03-01"> Mar 1, 2025</time>

Time and Date Value
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
<time datetime="2025-03-01 1820">Mar 1, 2025, 6:20 p.m.</time>

## Bold and Italics
Strong(<strong>) and Emphasis(<em>) Tags: Used to convey importance or emphasis. strong makes text bold, indicating greater importance while em makes text italic indicating stress emphasis.
Bold(<b>) and Itatlic(<i>) Tags: Used for stylistic purposes. <b> makes text bold without indicating higher importantance and <i> makes text italic for different prose, like foreign expressions or thoughts.
Semantic Meaning: Using the appropriate HTML tags helps communicate meaning to browsers, screen readers, and search engines for purely decorative purposes. CSS should be used instead.

## Character Entity reference
Special Characters: Characters references are used for characters not available on a standard keyboard, like the copyright symbol or arrows.
Formats: There are three  main formats for character references in HTML.
    Hex Code: starts with &.#,x, and ends with ;
    HTML Code starts with &,#, and ends with ;
    HTML Entity: starts with &, followed by a name(e.g.< for less than) and ends with ;
Usage: Character references are useful when you cant insert special characters directly into the code, such as displaying HTML tags as text or preventing line breaks with non-breaking spaces( )

&lt;h1&gt;heading&lt;/h1&gt; Both of these lines are <h1></h1>
    <h1>heading</h1>

&nbsp; non breaking space 

##  Formatting Text

## Code and Line breaks
Code Element(<code>) is used to display inline code with a monospaced font.
Preformatted Text(<pre>): Wraps multiple lines of code, preserving spaces and tabs for indentation.
Line Break(<br>): Adds a line break within a block of text, useful for formatting contetn like poems or addresses. It is a void element, meaning it doesn't require a closing tag.

## HTML and typography
Semantic Tags: Use tags that describe what the content means, not how it looks.
Superscript(<sup>) and Subscript(<sub>) Tags: Used for footnotes and notations, with superscript displaying smaller, raised text, and subscript displaying smaller, lowered text.
Small Element(<small>): Used for fine print like disclaimers or secondary information making the text appear smaller than the surrounding content.

## The basic HTML document
Doctype Declaration: The first line in an HTML document that tells the browser which version of HTML is being used.
HTML Element: The root element that contains all other HTML tags. It includes the lang attribute to specify the language of the page.
Meta Element: Used within the head tag to provide metadata about the HTML document
    meta charset: Specifies the character encoding to ensure special characters are displayed correctly
    meta viewport: Ensures the webpage is responsive by defining the width and inital scale of the viewport.
Head Tag: Contains metadata about the document including the title tag, which defines the webpage title, and meta tags for character encoding the viewport settings.
Body Element: Contains all the content to be displayed in the browser viewport


## Structuring content part 1
Basic structure: Header at the top, main content area in the middle, and a footer at the bottom.
HTML5 Structural Elemetns: HTML5 introduced new structural elements like header, main, and footer, reducing the need to use generic div tags
Header Element: Used for introductory content such as headings, logos, taglines, and navigation. It can include various types of content that doesnt require specific content.
Main Element: Represents the main content of the page and can only be used once per page.
Footer Element: Contains related content like copyright information credits, and links to related documents. It can be used multiple times on the same page

## Structuring content part 2
Section Element: Used to define standalone blocks of related content, each with a heading. It has semantic meaning and is used for major content blocks.
Article Element: Represents self-contained content that can be reused or distributed, like a magazine article or product description. Each article should include a heading. 
Aside Element: Used for content indirectly related to the main content, such as ads, author bios, or pull quotes. It helps in organizing supplementary information.

## HTML Tables
Structure: HTML tables are created using the <table> tag, with rows defined by <tr>, headers by <th>, and the data cells by td
Usage: Tables are mainly used for for organizing data in rows, and columns, such as price lists or comparison charts, they are less commonly used for layout purposes now.
Styling: Older HTML attributes for styling tables are deprecated, Instead, use CSS to add styles like border and text formatting for better readability.

HTML Tables
<table>                           <!--<Table> defines the table -->
    <caption>Description</caption><!-- <caption> Provides a description -->
    <tr>                          <!-- <tr> table rows -->
        <th>Heading, Column 1</th><!-- <th> table header -->
        <th>Heading, Column 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Row 2, column 1</td><!-- <td> table data -->
        <td>Row 2, column 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Row 3, column 1</td>
        <td>Row 3, column 2</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## The Document Object Model
DOM Structure: The DOM is represented as a tree structure where each node corresponds to a specific part of the document. 
Element Relationships: Terms like ancestor, descendant, parent, and sibling describe the relationships between eleements, similar to a family tree.
Importance for CSS and Javascript: Understanding these relationships is essential for targeting elements to apply styles and add functionality using CSS and Javascript.

# Links and Navigation
## The hyperlink
Historical Content: Tim Berners-Lee created key web technologies, including HTTP and URLs to organize and share information
Function of Hyperlinks: Hyperlinks allow users to navigate between different pages and resources on the internet by clicking on links embedded in webpages
Foundation of the internet: Hyperlinks revolutionized how information is accessed and shared online, forming the foundation of the modern internet.

## Relative and Absolute URLs
Anchor Element: Hyperlinks are created using the <a> tag with the href attribute specifying the link's destination.
Relative URLs: Used for internal links within your website. They can be simple file names or paths that reflect the folder structure.
    Same Directory: Use just the file name or ./filename.
    Subdirectory: Start with teh folder name, followed by the file name
    Parent Directory: Use ../ to go up one level in the directory.
Absolute URLs: Used for external links, they include the full URL with the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and domain name.

## Types of Links
Descriptive Link Text: Use descriptive text for links instead of vague phrases like "click here" to improve accessibility
In-Page Links: Create links that navigate to specific sections within the same page using the id attribute and hash symbol
Special Links: Use mailto: for email addresses and tel: for phone numbers to enable specific actions like opening an email program or dialing a number
Additional Attributes: Attributes like target="_blank", download, and title add functionality and extra information to links.

## Navigation
Nav Element: Represents navigation links and helps users navigate the website more easily. It can be placed in teh header, main section, article, or footer
Accessibility: Positioning the navigation first in the header improves accessibility by allowing users to access navigation options right away
Types of Navigation: Examples include a basic menu, a navigation menu with a submenu, and a breadcrumb navigation each organized using lists and styled with CSS for better usability.

# Images
## Image formats
Raster vs Vector Images: Raster images are made up of pixels and are best for photos, while vector images use mathematical equations and are ideal for illustrations and logos.
Common Formats:
    JPEG: Ideal for photos with rich color variations but does not support transparency
    GIF: Limited to 256 colors, supports transparency and can be animated
    PNG: Supports millions of colors and transparency, suitable for high-quality images
    WebP: Developed by Google, supports photos, animation, and transparency with smaller file sizes
    SVG: The only vector format discussed, best for 2D graphics and can be created with code or graphic software.

## Embedding Images
Using the Image tag: The <img> tag is used to add images to an HTML page. It is a void element, meaning it does not require a closing tag. The src attribute specifies the image file's location.
Relative vs Absolute URLs: Relative URLs point to files within your project directory while absolute URLs point to external resources
Placeholder Images: services like lorem picsum and Placeholder can provide temporary images for design and development. Can be useful when you dont have the final images ready
Alt Attribute: Always include the alt attribute to provide alternative text for screen readers and to display when an image fails to load. This improves accessibility and user experience

## Width and height Attributes
Width and Height attributes: These attributes can be added to the <img> tag to specify the dimensions of an image in pixels
Preventing layout shifts: Adding width and height attributes helps the browser reserbe space for images before they load, preventing layout shifts and improving user experience.
Aspect Ratio: When changing the size of an image maintaining the aspect ratio is crucial to avoid distortion. Setting only the width or height will automatically adjust the other dimensions proportionally.

## optimizing images
Resizing Images: Its important to resize images to the smallest dimensions needed for the web to optimize performance.
Resolution and Pixel Density: Higher resolution and pixel density(measured in PPI) result in sharper and more detailed images. High Pixel density screens like retina displays, require images with at atleast twice the resolution of standard screens
HTML and CSS Resizing: Use HTML or CSS to resize images based on screen size and resolution to ensure they display correctly across different devices.

## Developer tools and resizing images
Responsive Design Mode: Use browser developer tools like firefox;s responsive design mode, to test how images and layouts appear on different devices and screen sizes.
Resizing images with Pixlr: Pixlr is a free online photo editor that allows you to resize images proportionally, ensuring they fit well within your web design.
Testing and Exporting after resizing, test images across various screen resolutions and pixel densities. Export resized images as PNG files for web use.

## Responsive Images, Part 1
Responsive Web Design: Introduced by Ethan Marcotte in 2010, This design philosophy ensures websites adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
srcset Attribute Usin gthe srcset attribute in the <img> tag allows you to list multiple image files. The browser selects the most appropriate version based on conditions like pixel density.
Pixel Density Descriptors: You can specify different image files for standard and high-pixel sensity screens using descriptors like 1x and 2x.

## Responsive Images, Part 2
Width Descriptors: Use the srcset attribute with width descriptors (e.g. 400w, 800w) to specify image file widths allowing the browser to choose th emost appropriate image based on the viewport width
Sizes Attribute: The sizes attribute provides guidelines for the browser to select theh rigth image file based on media conditions( e.g. viewport width) and display size
Combining HTML and CSS: Use HTML for structuring content and CSS to style it, ensuring images are dispayed correctly across different devices and screensizes

## Responsive images with picture
The picture element allows you to provide multiple image sources tailored for different screen sizes, resolutions, and page designs
It works with the source element to specify media conditions and a list of image files, while the img element must be included for it to function properly.
Use the picture element when you need images with different compositions or completely different images based on viewport width an pixel density.
These will help ensure images are optimized for various devices, enhancing the user experience.

# More Media Elements
## Video 
File Formats: MP4 is the most widely supported format across all major browsers while Web< and OGG are also options.
Basic Syntax: The video element uses opening and closing tags, with teh source attribute to link to the media file. A fallback message is recommended for older browsers
Attributes: Key attributes include controls (for playback controls), autoplay, muted, and poster (for a custom preview image.)

<video src="customize-vs-code.mp4">
    <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML video. Here is a <a href="customize-vs-code.mp4"> link to the video </a> instead</p>
</video>


<video>
    <source src="how-to-customize-vs-code.wepm"
            type="video/wepm">
    <source src="how-to-customize-vs-code.mp4"
            controls autoplay loop muted
            type="video/mp4">
    <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML video.
        Here is a <a href="customize-vs-code.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.
    </p>
</video>

## Adding captions and subtitles
Track Element: The <track> element is used to add captions, subtitles, and chapters to video and audio elements.
File Format: Track files use the WebVVT format with a .vtt file extension
Attributes: Important attributes include kind (specifies the type of text track), src (source of the VVT file) and srclang (language of the subtitles).
    The Kind Attribute possible values:
        captions are the transcription of theh audio
        subtitles provide a translation of the audio
        chapters are markers that divide content into sections
        metadata provides additional information about the media(such as descriptions or annotations)
Server Requirements: The <track> element requires a server environment to function properly due to security restrictions. The live server plugin can be used for local testing.

## Audio
Audio Element: The <audio> element is specifically designed for audio files, providing clear semantic meaning and better accessibility
Attributes: Key attributes include source(to link the adio file) and controls(to display player controls). Without the controls attribute, the audio element wont display.
Formats: The primary audio forms are MP3(widely supported and small file silzes), WAV (high quality but larger file sizes), and OGG(good quality and smaller file sizes).

<audio controls>
    <source src="example-audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="example-audio.wav" type="audio/wav">
    <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML audio. Download the <a href="example-audio.wav">WAV</a>
    or <a href="example-audio.mp3">MP3</a> file instead.

## Embedding media with iframes
iframe Element: The <iframe> element allows you to embed content from one webpage into another, such as videos, maps, forms, and more.
Attributes: Important attributes include src(URL of the content to embed), Width, height, and title (for accessibility)
Customization: You can modify the width, and height of the embedded content. Additional attributes can control behaviors and security settings.

## What are web forms?
User Interaction: Web Forms are essential for user interaction on websites, such as filling out quizzes, signing up for newsletters, or entering payment details.
Complexity: Forms can range from simple(name and email) to complex(address, billing, and payment information)
HTML Role: The user interface elements of forms, like text fields, and submit buttons, are created using HTML, while server-side programming handles data processing.

## HTML form basics
Form Structure: Forms start with the <form> tag, using the action attribute to specify where data is sent and the method attribute to determine how data is sent(GET or POST).
Input Elements: The <input> element is used for various types of data input and each input should be paired a <label> for better usability.
Form Enhancements: Use additional elements like <div>, <fieldset>, and <legend> to improve the structure and functionality of forms. Establishing connections between labels and inputs using for and id attributes enhances usability
