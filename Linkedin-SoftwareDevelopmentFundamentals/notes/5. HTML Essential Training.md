## Languages of the web
The web was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 to share information without emails. It started with text-based documents and has evolved significantly. 
Front-end Languages control what you see in a browser which includes:
    Hhypertext Markup Language (HTML)
    CSS
    Javascript 
Back-end languages handle server-side functionality and may include 
    PHP
    Ruby
    Ruby
    Java
    Python
Full-Stack Development is the lines between front-end and back-end development have blurred with Javascript frameworks like Node.js, React, and Angular Leading to the rise of full-stack developers. 
Full-Stack Developers: Someone who work with both front-end and back-end technologies.
